# Hi, I'm **mushytoast**  
## I am a developer!  
## I am fluent in 3 languages, **Lua, JavaScript, and Python!**   

I don't really use JavaScript that much, as I mainly steer away from web developing.   
My main developing platform is Roblox Lua, where I make games!     

## What I've done:  
### A color picker website (WIP)   
### A website featuring my friend's cats (old, first website I made)   
### A python library for quality-of-life functions (WIP)   
### Multiple high-quality roblox games   

## More about me:
Hi, my real name is **Nolan**, and I live in California   
I've been developing for nearly 3 years now, and it all started way back with Scratch
