# Hi, I'm **mushytoast**  
## I am a developer!  
## I am fluent in 3 languages, **Lua, JavaScript, and Python!**   

I don't really use JavaScript that much, as I mainly steer away from web developing.   
My main developing platform is Roblox Lua, where I make games!     

## What I've done:  
### A color picker website (WIP)   
### A website featuring my friend's cats (old, first website I made)   
### A python library for quality-of-life functions (WIP)   
### Multiple high-quality roblox games      

## More about me:   
Hi, my real name is **Nolan**, and I live in California     
I've been developing for nearly 3 years now, and it all started way back with Scratch    
I have an everlasting love for computers.   

## Mi amigos
### [CJdough](https://github.com/CJdough) great web and python developer    
### [DevDodger](https://github.com/DevDodger/) my current best friend, who is way better at me then coding !!  
### [Ultracodez](https://github.com/ultracodez) one of my developer friends  

## My hobbies (besides programming)  
### I really enjoy cooking/baking, and eating too!    
### I enjoy riding my bike, and actually *touching grass!*   

I don't really do things for people, other than Roblox commissions for Robux. If you would like me to do a commission for you, head to my [website](https://mushytoast.github.io/)
